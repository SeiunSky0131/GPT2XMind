Learning and memorizing knowledge with complex structures is always a tough process. Take the preparation of technical interviews for Data Science/Computer Science positions as an example, students are required to memorize knowledge from multiple sub-disciplines including Operating System, Databases, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architectureâ€¦in order to be well prepared for the potential interview questions. Meanwhile, each of the sub-disciplines contains hundreds of details to understand and recite. 

A well-developed mind map will definitely assist students to gain an overview of the knowledge structure, and thus help students to recite them. But constructing a mind map is a time consuming task with lots of time spent on searching and typing relevant texts. Recently, the publication of ChatGPT enables fast search with sophisticated responses. It would be desirable to get ChatGPT encapsulated into an automatic mind map building process.
